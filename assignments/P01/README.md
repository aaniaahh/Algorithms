# Presentation 1 - Red-Black Trees

## Purpose
This short presentation was an opportunity for us to dive deep into an algorithm or data structure topic. Allowing us to explain it clearly and confidently to our peers. The main focus was on communication, conceptual understanding, and clarity.

## Powerpoint
Click [here](https://github.com/aaniaahh/Algorithms/blob/main/assigments/P01/Red-Black%20Trees%20(1).pptx) to view our presentation that was shared with the class.

## Now try on your own
**Use 20, 15, 25, 10, 5, 1, 30, 35, 40, 45 to create a red-black tree**

You will need
- Paper
- Red Pen
- Black Pen

Violations to look out for:
- Possible recoloring
- All leafs (Null or NIL) must be black
- Root must always be black
- Possible Left and Right Rotations
- Red child always under Black Parent
- Possible Left or Right-leaning Insertions
